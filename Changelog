Version 9:
	- Changed default location for GB_BASE_DIR from ~/git to ~/gbm. You should override GB_BASE_DIR to ~/git in your ~/.bashrc (before loading gbm) if you are upgrading from an older version.
	- Changed 'finish' subcommand to 'publish'.
	- Hid 'start' subcommand, just type a new branch name and you will be prompted to create it.
